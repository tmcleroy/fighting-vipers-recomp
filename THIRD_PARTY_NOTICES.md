## In this repository

### Ymir (GPL-3.0)

[Ymir](https://github.com/StrikerX3/Ymir), a Sega Saturn emulator by StrikerX3 and contributors,
is the reference this port's machine was developed against, and is not part of the port: no Ymir
source is compiled or linked into the game, and the emulator is not in this repository.

- **The machine's own models** (`satrecomp/machine/`, `satrecomp/video/`, `satrecomp/sound/`,
  `satrecomp/runtime/backup.*`) were written for this project, with Ymir's source open beside
  them and each checked against Ymir state for state. Register layouts, timing tables and
  instruction timings were read from it, and many names of registers and fields, and in places a
  line or an expression, are the same as Ymir's. Where the law would call any of that derived
  from Ymir, it is used under the GPL-3.0, and this is its notice.
- **The VDP1's counters** (`satrecomp/video/counters.h`: how the chip steps along lines, quad edges,
  textures and shading) are this project's code. The counting rules are the hardware's, and were
  learnt from Ymir's `vdp1_steppers.hpp`, a copy of which this file replaced; the two were compared
  on billions of cases and give the same results.
- **The development reference build** (`make setup`, `make ref`) fetches Ymir from its own repository
  and applies a patch that is kept outside this one. The files here that are compiled only into
  that build (`video/ymir_adapter.*`, `sound/generator.*`, `runtime/m68k_*`) are this project's,
  written against Ymir's interfaces.

### wiiparty-recomp (GPL-3.0-or-later) and recomp-common (GPL-3.0)

`satrecomp/recomp-common/` is a copy of [recomp-common](https://github.com/tmcleroy/recomp-common)
(the in-game menu, the settings rules and the launcher; this author's, GPL-3.0), made by
`satrecomp/tools/sync-common.sh` and never changed here. Its launcher descends from the launcher of
[wiiparty-recomp](https://github.com/arelkair/wiiparty-recomp) by arelkair (GPL-3.0-or-later):
`launcher/src/ui.cpp`, `ui.h` and `embedded.h` are that project's files nearly unchanged and are
marked GPL-3.0-or-later; `main.cpp`, parts of `app.cpp`, `game_process.cpp` and `embed_fonts.cmake`
follow it. recomp-common's own `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` has the table, file by file.

The 5x7 dot-matrix font of the menu (`satrecomp/recomp-common/text.h`) is the generic character
set of LCD and LED displays, typed in for recomp-common.

Each download is checked against its published SHA-256. Release archives carry the license texts of
SDL 3, Dear ImGui and Inter in a `licenses/` folder, beside this file and the GPL-3.0.

## Tools used to build (not included in builds)

Python, CMake, Ninja, a C++ compiler; glslangValidator and SPIRV-Cross to regenerate
`satrecomp/video/shaders.inc` from the shaders in `satrecomp/video/shaders/` (which are this
project's).

## What is not included

Nothing from *Fighting Vipers* or the Saturn itself is in this repository: no game code, data,
graphics, sound or text, no BIOS, and no files from Sega's development kits. The port provides the
BIOS's services with code of its own (`satrecomp/runtime/hle_bios.cpp`), written from watching what
a game asks of them; the comments there use the names by which the backup library's functions are
publicly known. Release builds contain code translated from the game by the recompiler; the game's
data is read from each player's own disc image.

Code added later from another project must have a license compatible with the GPL-3.0 and be listed
here, with its notice kept in the file. `tools/audit.sh` fails if a file marked as another
project's is not one of those listed above, and on any patch file or emulator's source.
