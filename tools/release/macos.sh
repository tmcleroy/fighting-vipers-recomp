# Release build for macOS, Apple silicon and Intel in one: "<Game>.app" (the launcher, with the game
# beside it) zipped as build/release/<Game>-macos.zip. SDL3 is linked statically and the programs run on
# macOS 13 and later. ARCHS=arm64 makes it for Apple silicon only (half the time). The app is signed ad hoc (not notarized), so macOS warns the first time it is opened.
